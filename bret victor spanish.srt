1
00:00:07,311 --> 00:00:11,916
A difirencia de la conferencia pasada, no tengo premios para dar.

2
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:14,182
Solo te voy a decir como vivir tu vida.

3
00:00:14,752 --> 00:00:21,188
Esta charla es en realidad sobre una forma de vivir tu vida que la mayoria de la gente no conoce.

4
00:00:21,758 --> 00:00:28,202
A medida que te acerques a tu carrera, vas a escuchar un monton acerca de como "seguir tu pasion",

5
00:00:28,202 --> 00:00:31,068
o "hacer algo que amas".

6
00:00:31,068 --> 00:00:33,337
Voy a hablarles sobre algo un poco diferente.

7
00:00:33,337 --> 00:00:36,964
Voy a hablar sobre seguir un principio,

8
00:00:37,241 --> 00:00:41,013
encontrar un principio guia para tu trabajo, algo que creas que es importante

9
00:00:41,013 --> 00:00:45,148
necesario y correcto, y lo uses para guiar lo que haces.

10
00:00:45,148 --> 00:00:48,486
Hay tres partes en esta conferencia.

11
00:00:48,486 --> 00:00:51,923
Primero voy a hablar sobre el principio que guia mucho de mi trabajo,

12
00:00:51,923 --> 00:00:54,358
y tratar de que echen un vistazo de lo que se obtiene de eso.

13
00:00:54,358 --> 00:00:58,496
Y, voy a hablar sobre otras personas que han vivido su vida de éste modo.

14
00:00:58,496 --> 00:00:59,980
cuales son sus principios, en que creen.

15
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:06,738
Pero esos son todos ejemplo, para ayudar a pensar en que crees tu,

16
00:01:06,738 --> 00:01:09,818
y como quieres vivir tu vida.

17
00:01:11,342 --> 00:01:15,147
Para empezar conmigo: Las ideas son muy importantes.

18
00:01:15,147 --> 00:01:21,140
Yo pienso que traer ideas al mundo es una de las cosas mas importantes que la gente hace.

19
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:29,224
Y también pienso que las grandes ideas, en forma de arte genial, historias, invenciones, teorias cientificas,

20
00:01:29,224 --> 00:01:32,799
esas toman vida propia,

21
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,302
que da sentido a nuestas vidas como personas.

22
00:01:35,317 --> 00:01:40,036
Yo pienso mucho acerca de como las personas crean ideas, y en como las ideas crecen.

23
00:01:40,036 --> 00:01:46,307
Y en particular, que conjunto de herramientas crean un ambiente saludable para que las ideas crezcan.

24
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:51,148
Ahora, he pasado mucho de mi tiempo a traves de los años haciendo herramientas creativas, usandolas,

25
00:01:51,148 --> 00:01:54,925
pensando mucho sobre ellas, y aqui esta algo que he llegado a creer:

26
00:01:55,556 --> 00:02:01,306
Los inventores necesitan una coneccion inmediata con lo que estan creando.

27
00:02:01,306 --> 00:02:02,474
Ese es mi prinicipio.

28
00:02:02,474 --> 00:02:06,063
Los inventores necesitan una coneccion con lo que crean.

29
00:02:06,063 --> 00:02:10,306
Lo que trato de decir con esto es que cuando estas haciendo algo, si haces un cambio,

30
00:02:10,306 --> 00:02:14,271
o tomas una desciscion, tu nescesitas ver un efecto inmediato sobre eso.

31
00:02:14,271 --> 00:02:18,109
No puede haber una demora, no puede haber nada oculto.

32
00:02:18,109 --> 00:02:20,846
Los inventores tiene que ser capaces de ver lo que estan haciendo

33
00:02:20,846 --> 00:02:25,223
Ahora voy a mostrarles una serie de casos donde note que este principio es violado

34
00:02:25,223 --> 00:02:28,118
Y también voy a mostrarles que hice al respecto.

35
00:02:28,118 --> 00:02:31,872
Y luego voy a hablarles de un contexto mayor, en donde esto funciona

36
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:36,307
Para empezar, pensemos acerca de programar.

37
00:02:36,307 --> 00:02:39,530
Asi es como la programación funciona : escribes un monton de codigo en un editor de texto,

38
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:43,934
tratas de imaginar en tu cabeza que hara cada linea de codigo.

39
00:02:43,934 --> 00:02:47,805
Y luego los complias y ejecutas, y algo sucede.

40
00:02:47,805 --> 00:02:53,060
En este caso, esto es solo JavaScript, Canvas, y dibuja este pequeño árbol.

41
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,317
Pero, si hay algo mal en la escena,

42
00:02:56,331 --> 00:03:00,418
o si voy y hago cambios, o si tengo mas ideas

43
00:03:00,418 --> 00:03:02,287
Tengo que ir devuelta al código,

44
00:03:02,287 --> 00:03:05,339
y editar, compilarlo y ejecutarlo,

45
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:07,786
Mirar como luce.

46
00:03:07,786 --> 00:03:08,959
Si algo va mal, vas devuelta al código.

47
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,765
La mayoría de mi tiempo lo paso en el código, trabajando a ciegas en un editor de texto,

48
00:03:13,765 --> 00:03:17,320
sin una conexión inmediata a lo que hago,

49
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,953
que es lo que tratare de hacer.

50
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:22,707
Siento que esto va encontra del principio que tengo,

51
00:03:22,707 --> 00:03:26,383
que un inventor necesita una conexión inmediata con lo que esta creando,

52
00:03:26,383 --> 00:03:32,991
he probado un entorno de programacion que va a ser mucho mas acorde a mi principio.

53
00:03:33,884 --> 00:03:40,724
Lo que tengo aquí es una foto en un lado y el código en el otro,

54
00:03:40,724 --> 00:03:44,916
y esta parte dibuja el cielo y esta parte las montañas.

55
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:47,343
esto dibuja un arbol,

56
00:03:47,343 --> 00:03:49,570
y cuando hago cualquier cambio al código

57
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:52,820
el dibujo cambia inmediatamente.

58
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:57,008
El código y el dibujo estan siempre sincronizados, no hay un compliar y ejecutar.

59
00:03:57,008 --> 00:04:00,684
Yo solo cambio cosas en el código

60
00:04:00,684 --> 00:04:04,594
y veo el cambio en el código.

61
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,149
Y ahora que tenemos esta conexión inmediata entre

62
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:09,506
el código y el dibujo,

63
00:04:09,506 --> 00:04:12,555
podemos pensar maneras de cambiar el código fuera de tipear...

64
00:04:12,555 --> 00:04:16,161
Por ejemplo, este numero es la cantidad de ramas

65
00:04:16,161 --> 00:04:18,428
Si quisiera controlar ese numero, solo tengo que apuntar mi puntero a él,

66
00:04:18,428 --> 00:04:22,587
presionar mi tecla ctrl, y subir y bajar el valor del numero.

67
00:04:24,034 --> 00:04:27,218
Yo puedo ver como luce muchas ramas o pocas ramas

68
00:04:27,218 --> 00:04:31,576
y puedo llenar con lo que me parece artisticamente correcto.

69
00:04:31,576 --> 00:04:32,732
Y funciona para cualquier numero en el código

70
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:35,492
Solo apunto a él y lo subo y bajo

71
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:37,856
Y algunos de estos numeros aquí, se lo que hacen

72
00:04:37,856 --> 00:04:42,217
Pero aun es algo sorprendete verlos hacerlo [risas]

73
00:04:42,217 --> 00:04:46,147
Y otras acciones son completamente sorprendentes

74
00:04:46,147 --> 00:04:47,725
[risas]

75
00:04:48,771 --> 00:04:50,919
Estoy aquí, tengo este

76
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:52,854
bucle donde estoy contando hasta dicesiceis,

77
00:04:52,854 --> 00:04:56,266
Estoy poniendo dieciseis pequeñas flores rosas en cada rama.

78
00:04:56,266 --> 00:05:00,439
Y puedo bajar el numero para menos flores o subirlo para más.

79
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:03,463
Pero, miren a lo que estoy haciendo aquí:

80
00:05:03,463 --> 00:05:07,334
**Solo estoy moviendo ese número hacia arriba y abajo alrededor de veinto o parecido:

81
00:05:07,334 --> 00:05:09,111
y tiene un efecto reluciente muy interesante;

82
00:05:09,111 --> 00:05:13,183
parece como que el viento esta soplando entre los arboles.

83
00:05:13,183 --> 00:05:15,986
Y la primera vez que vi esto inmediatamente me puse a pensar sobre ello

84
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:20,391
como podría usar este efecto para una animación.

85
00:05:20,391 --> 00:05:25,463
Cómo podría haber descubierto eso si hubiese tenido que compilar y ejecutar entre cada cambio?

86
00:05:25,463 --> 00:05:28,867
Mucho del arte, mucho de la invencion es descubrimiento,

87
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:32,629
y no puedes descubrir nada si no logras ver lo que estas haciendo.

88
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:36,107
Les he mostrado que sucede modificando el código, vamos a agregar algo de código.

89
00:05:36,107 --> 00:05:38,468
Me gustaría poner un sol aquí en el cielo,

90
00:05:38,468 --> 00:05:41,010
Ire a la función dibujarCielo,

91
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,213
y quiero rellenar en un círculo,

92
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:46,250
empiezo a escribir contexto.llenarCirculo,

93
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,826
y apenas que empiezo a escribir, recibo la lista de autcompletado

94
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:51,159
de los diferentes metodos de llenado.

95
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:55,876
Estos son las cosas que puedo tipear aqui: llenarCirculo, llenarRectangulo, llenarTexto.

96
00:05:55,876 --> 00:05:58,088
y cuando me muevo para arriba o para abajo en esta lista de autocompletado,

97
00:05:58,088 --> 00:06:02,278
Inmediatamente veo que hace cada una de ellas.

98
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:05,669
Yo no tengo que imaginar que hara a partir del nombre del metodo.

99
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:08,026
No tengo que mirar la documentación,

100
00:06:08,026 --> 00:06:11,068
Yo lo veo, inmediatamente.

101
00:06:11,068 --> 00:06:12,232
Yo quiero un círculo,

102
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,966
y solo voy a ajustar la coordenada X

103
00:06:14,966 --> 00:06:16,509
y la coordenada Y,

104
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,208
cambiar el radio un poco...

105
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,698
And that looks about right.
***y mirar

106
00:06:22,698 --> 00:06:24,125
Probablemente debería ser amarillo,

107
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,988
así que voy a definir el estilo de pintado

108
00:06:25,988 --> 00:06:28,960
Context.fillStyle, el mismo autocompletado como antes antes,

109
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,143
elijo el estilo

110
00:06:31,143 --> 00:06:34,157
me ofrece color "blanco" por omisión,

111
00:06:34,157 --> 00:06:37,662
y puedo cambiar ese código de color de la misma forma que cambio cualquier número,

112
00:06:37,662 --> 00:06:42,806
Puso la tecla control, y obtendo una paleta de colores.

113
00:06:42,806 --> 00:06:46,733
Así que elijo a lindo color amarillo para mi sol.

114
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,851
Aunque... el blanco tiene algo interesante, pienso...

115
00:06:52,851 --> 00:06:53,784
Algo que no esperaba, pero,

116
00:06:53,784 --> 00:06:58,551
con el blanco, se parece mas a una luna, cierto ?

117
00:07:00,105 --> 00:07:05,397
Hey, se ve que ahora es de noche...

118
00:07:05,397 --> 00:07:08,765
Tener una conexión inmediata permite a las ideas salir a la superficie

119
00:07:08,765 --> 00:07:13,584
y desarrollar en formas que antes eran imposibles.

120
00:07:17,508 --> 00:07:19,128
Pero, pienso que aún existe un problema aquí.

121
00:07:19,128 --> 00:07:21,286
Es este: tengo este dibujo,

122
00:07:21,286 --> 00:07:23,310
tengo este código al lado,


123
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,920
y tengo que manetener un mapa en mi cabeza que los relaciona a los dos.


124
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,151
Así que tengo todas estas lineas de código,

125
00:07:28,151 --> 00:07:33,057
y si miro esta linea, no puede ver inmediatamente que hace.

126
00:07:33,057 --> 00:07:34,491
Así que esto es lo que puedo hacer:

127
00:07:34,491 --> 00:07:36,372
Puedo mantener pulsada la tecla Option,

128
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,983
mi cursor se convierte en una lupa,

129
00:07:38,983 --> 00:07:40,656
y ahora cuando de deplazo sobre cada linea de código,

130
00:07:40,656 --> 00:07:42,672
aparece resaltado el dibujo

131
00:07:42,672 --> 00:07:46,904
eso es lo que está siendo dibujado por esa linea.

132
00:07:46,904 --> 00:07:49,807
Entonces, si quiero conocer qué está haciendo esta funciíon,

133
00:07:49,807 --> 00:07:54,662
Solo exploro dentro de la función y veo qué aparece resaltado.

134
00:07:56,848 --> 00:08:00,018
Aquí tengo dos llamadas a drawMountain; no se cual es cual;

135
00:08:00,018 --> 00:08:03,052
bueno, esta es esa montaña, y esta es esa otra montaña.

136
00:08:03,052 --> 00:08:04,587
Y esto funcionaría de la otra forma también;

137
00:08:04,587 --> 00:08:06,532
si veo una parte del dibujo,

138
00:08:06,532 --> 00:08:09,575
Necesito conocer que código fué el responsable de dibujarlo.

139
00:08:09,575 --> 00:08:12,095
Así que hago lo mismo, mantengo pulsada la tecla Option,

140
00:08:12,095 --> 00:08:15,116
y mientras me muevo sobre cada pixel del dibujo,

141
00:08:15,116 --> 00:08:16,132
como ven a la derecha

142
00:08:16,132 --> 00:08:20,472
salta a la linea de código que dibujó ese pixel.

143
00:08:20,472 --> 00:08:23,073
Así esto dibujo el cielo, y esto dibujó el árbol

144
00:08:23,073 --> 00:08:25,849
Esto dibujo las hojas

145
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,463
Es realmente importante hacer esta vinculación

146
00:08:29,463 --> 00:08:33,749
Pero también es realmente útil navegar alrededor


147
00:08:33,749 --> 00:08:35,860
Así, quiero hacer que el sol sea un poco mas grande.

148
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,818
Salto ahí, lo hago un poco mas grande

149
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:39,915
Quiero hacer crecer un poquito el árbol,

150
00:08:39,915 --> 00:08:42,358
así que salto ahí, y hago crecer el árbol un poco.

151
00:08:42,358 --> 00:08:43,833
Quiero agrandar las montañas un poco.


152
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,844
Voy ahí, agrando las montañas un poco

153
00:08:46,844 --> 00:08:51,301
Y puedo hacer estos cambios tan rápidos como se me van ocurriendo

154
00:08:51,301 --> 00:08:54,137
Y es tan importante para el proceso creativo -

155
00:08:54,137 --> 00:08:57,931
ser capaz de intentar ideas mientras pensás en ellas

156
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,812
Que si hubiera alguna demora en esa comunicación

157
00:09:01,812 --> 00:09:06,821
entre pensar acerca de algo, verlo y contruir sobre eso


158
00:09:06,821 --> 00:09:09,627
Entonces, existe este mundo entero de ideas, en donde ...

159
00:09:09,627 --> 00:09:12,708
en donde nunca van a poder nacer...

160
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,051
Estas son ideas en las que no podemos pensar...

161
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,654
Las ideas son muy importenes para mi.

162
00:09:36,654 --> 00:09:41,617
Y la cosa acerca de las ideas, es que las ideas comienzan siendo pequeñas.

163
00:09:41,617 --> 00:09:45,203
Las ideas surgen, pequeñas, débiles y frágiles.

164
00:09:45,203 --> 00:09:46,879
Para que las ideas se puedan desarroollar y madurar,

165
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,138
las ideas necesitan un entorno

166
00:09:49,138 --> 00:09:51,228
donde el inventor puede nutrirlas.

167
00:09:51,228 --> 00:09:54,297
Tomar algún tipo de cuidado, alimentárlas, darles formas para que puedan crecer.

168
00:09:54,297 --> 00:09:59,839
Y para mí, ese es el fundamento completo del principio de conexión inmediata.

169
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,755
Y porque las ideas son valiosas para mí,

170
00:10:02,755 --> 00:10:05,489
cuando veo este principio violado,

171
00:10:05,489 --> 00:10:10,286
cuando veo que las ideas se paralizan porque sus inventores no pudieron ver qué estában haciendo

172
00:10:10,286 --> 00:10:12,916
Siento que eso está mal.

173
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,880
Y no "mal" en el sentido de no respetar

174
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,573
alguna guia de estílo o ir en contra buena práctica, sino

175
00:10:18,573 --> 00:10:21,558
"mal" en un sentido mas profundo.

176
00:10:21,558 --> 00:10:25,369
And I'll come back to this, but I want to show you another example of following this principle.

177
00:10:25,369 --> 00:10:28,632
So, in this code here, there is no state

178
00:10:28,632 --> 00:10:32,803
There is no time, there is no interactivity.

179
00:10:32,803 --> 00:10:37,040
And I was thinking about how we would handle those aspects of coding

180
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,370
in a way that's inline with this principle that I have,

181
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:42,259
that creators need an immediate connection.

182
00:10:42,658 --> 00:10:46,516
So, what I have here, is a little platform game.

183
00:10:46,516 --> 00:10:50,118
Here is my little guy, he can run around, he can jump,

184
00:10:50,118 --> 00:10:53,190
he can die [chuckles].

185
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,706
And the code for him is over here.

186
00:10:54,706 --> 00:10:56,453
So this code makes him run around,

187
00:10:56,453 --> 00:10:58,027
this makes him jump,

188
00:10:58,027 --> 00:11:00,464
this makes him collide with things...

189
00:11:00,464 --> 00:11:05,070
and down here, I've got some code for this little turtle.

190
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,665
And this turtle is not doing much right now

191
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:08,795
because I haven't finished writing this code,

192
00:11:08,795 --> 00:11:11,141
so, I'm just going to do that right now.

193
00:11:11,141 --> 00:11:16,311
So on each tick, x position plus equals his direction

194
00:11:16,311 --> 00:11:19,635
times the time interval one sixtieth of a second

195
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:21,951
times some speed,

196
00:11:21,951 --> 00:11:27,591
which, um, I dunno? Could be fast, could be slow

197
00:11:27,591 --> 00:11:33,463
if it's negative, he walks backwards. [chuckles]

198
00:11:33,463 --> 00:11:35,999
And these are all ideas, I can use for other enemies

199
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:39,202
but I think turtles are supposed to be slow,

200
00:11:39,202 --> 00:11:42,739
so let's set a good speed for a turtle

201
00:11:42,739 --> 00:11:46,009
And then up here, I've got some code that says:

202
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:49,681
"When my guy, collides with the turtle, he gets some Y velocity".

203
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:53,582
So it bounces into the air and the turtle gets stopped.

204
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:55,488
So that looks like that.

205
00:11:55,488 --> 00:11:59,085
And the the turtle gets up after a bit.

206
00:12:00,824 --> 00:12:05,529
The problem is, I don't want the player to be able to get up there yet.

207
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:07,597
I want the player to bounce up the turtle,

208
00:12:07,597 --> 00:12:10,300
and go through this little passageway down there.

209
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,815
It'll have to go around and solve puzzles and whatnot,

210
00:12:13,815 --> 00:12:15,533
to come back and get the star.

211
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:18,308
So, the turtle is too bouncy right now.

212
00:12:18,308 --> 00:12:21,649
Now of course I could just turn that down in the code,

213
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:23,692
and now I can try it

214
00:12:23,692 --> 00:12:26,440
but, but now it's not bouncy enough.

215
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,420
So while it's nice that I can adjust the code while it's running,

216
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,856
without having to stop and recompile and find that place again

217
00:12:33,856 --> 00:12:36,559
I can't immediately see what I need to see,

218
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:39,715
which is whether or not I make that jump.

219
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:42,566
So here's what I'm going to do.

220
00:12:42,566 --> 00:12:44,563
I'm going to bounce off the turtle,

221
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,155
and pause the game.

222
00:12:46,155 --> 00:12:49,441
So I pause the game, and now there's a slider up here,

223
00:12:49,441 --> 00:12:52,301
which lets me rewind through time.

224
00:12:57,811 --> 00:13:01,251
And now, I could rewind to back before I made the jump,

225
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:03,896
and change the code, make it less bouncy

226
00:13:03,896 --> 00:13:05,695
and now when I move it forward,

227
00:13:05,695 --> 00:13:07,374
it's going to simulate it, using the same input controls,

228
00:13:07,374 --> 00:13:09,499
the same keyboard commands as before,

229
00:13:09,499 --> 00:13:11,808
but the new code.

230
00:13:11,808 --> 00:13:21,083
[applause]

231
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:25,343
This is not good enough. [laughter]

232
00:13:25,343 --> 00:13:27,811
I need to be able to see the changes immediately.

233
00:13:27,811 --> 00:13:29,284
I need to be able to see immediately

234
00:13:29,284 --> 00:13:33,913
whether or not my bounciness is correct.

235
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:37,021
None of this stuff.

236
00:13:37,021 --> 00:13:38,864
And if you have a process in time,

237
00:13:38,864 --> 00:13:40,747
and you want to see changes immediately,

238
00:13:40,747 --> 00:13:43,646
you have to map time to space.

239
00:13:43,646 --> 00:13:45,397
So here's what I'm going to do.

240
00:13:45,397 --> 00:13:48,499
I'm going to bounce off my turtle, pause the game,

241
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:50,462
and now hit this button here,

242
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:53,787
which shows my guys trail.

243
00:13:53,787 --> 00:13:56,574
So now I can see where he's been.

244
00:13:56,574 --> 00:13:59,509
And now when I rewind,

245
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:02,850
this trail in front of him, is where he is going to be.

246
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,082
This is his future.

247
00:14:05,082 --> 00:14:10,954
And when I change the code, I change his future. [gasps]

248
00:14:10,954 --> 00:14:13,570
So I can find exactly the value I need,

249
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:17,393
so when I hit play, he slips right in there.

250
00:14:17,393 --> 00:14:25,476
[applause]

251
00:14:26,336 --> 00:14:28,311
So, creators need to be able to see what they're doing.

252
00:14:28,311 --> 00:14:30,268
If you're designing something embedded in time

253
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:31,827
you need to be able to control time.

254
00:14:31,827 --> 00:14:34,111
You need to be able to see across time,

255
00:14:34,111 --> 00:14:36,398
otherwise you're designing blind.

256
00:14:39,306 --> 00:14:42,486
As I was playing with this, I noticed it's fun to play with gravity.

257
00:14:42,486 --> 00:14:47,896
So I can make gravity a little negative and he starts to float up in the air. [laughter]

258
00:14:47,896 --> 00:14:52,462
And I can kind of play with that and try to get him to stay there.

259
00:14:52,462 --> 00:14:59,770
And you could probably make an entire game around just the mechanic here - gravity manipulation.

260
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:05,375
In fact, I bet I could fiddle with any part of this code and come up with an idea for a game.

261
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:11,182
Even if I just comment out the first statement in the code,

262
00:15:11,182 --> 00:15:14,966
now my guy can't move left - he can only move right.

263
00:15:15,952 --> 00:15:17,321
Which sounds kinda silly, but

264
00:15:17,321 --> 00:15:19,229
Terry Cavanagh actually made a beautiful game

265
00:15:19,229 --> 00:15:23,925
around that concept called "Don't Look Back".

266
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:26,763
Terry Cavanagh, he made another really wonderful game

267
00:15:26,763 --> 00:15:31,801
which you might have seen, called "V", spelled as the letter v six times.

268
00:15:31,801 --> 00:15:35,338
And, the way that game works, is that you can't jump.

269
00:15:35,338 --> 00:15:37,909
Instead, you can only flip upside down,

270
00:15:37,909 --> 00:15:40,777
and you fall up instead of falling down.

271
00:15:40,777 --> 00:15:43,246
So it kinda works like this.

272
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:46,183
You can walk on the ceiling or you can walk around on the ground.

273
00:15:46,183 --> 00:15:50,120
And so you have these levels, which kind of look like this

274
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:56,896
And you kind of walk around and you have to learn how to navigate turning like this

275
00:15:56,896 --> 00:16:01,108
And so if you have like, something like that, you won't be able to jump over

276
00:16:01,108 --> 00:16:03,701
You'll have to like flip over and flip over

277
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:07,646
And he got an amazing amount of game play out of this concept

278
00:16:07,646 --> 00:16:12,278
So again, being able to try ideas as you think of them.

279
00:16:25,588 --> 00:16:28,228
This example, and the last one with the tree,

280
00:16:28,228 --> 00:16:30,526
these are both very visual programs;

281
00:16:30,526 --> 00:16:32,996
we're able to see our changes just by seeing how the picture changes.

282
00:16:32,996 --> 00:16:37,734
So I was thinking about, how we could do more abstract coding

283
00:16:37,734 --> 00:16:39,146
that's more in line with this principle.

284
00:16:39,146 --> 00:16:44,407
How can we write a generic algorithm in such a way that we can see what we're doing.

285
00:16:44,407 --> 00:16:48,578
So as an example, let's take a look at binary search.

286
00:16:48,578 --> 00:16:51,615
Super quick refresher on how binary search works:

287
00:16:51,615 --> 00:16:53,985
you have an array of values that are in order,

288
00:16:53,985 --> 00:16:58,155
and you have a key, which is the value you're trying to locate within the array.

289
00:16:58,155 --> 00:17:01,158
And you keep track of two variables, which are the lower and upper bounds

290
00:17:01,158 --> 00:17:03,556
of where you think that value could possibly be;

291
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,894
right now, it could be anywhere.

292
00:17:05,894 --> 00:17:08,472
And you look right in the middle of that range -

293
00:17:08,472 --> 00:17:12,568
if what you find is too small, then the key has to be after that.

294
00:17:12,568 --> 00:17:13,971
Look in the middle of the range,

295
00:17:13,971 --> 00:17:16,039
if what you find is too big, the key has to be before that.

296
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:18,875
And you kind of keep subdividing array into intervals

297
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:22,178
You narrow in on value you're looking for

298
00:17:22,178 --> 00:17:27,082
And in code, binary search looks like this

299
00:17:27,082 --> 00:17:29,753
And from my perspective, you can't see anything in here

300
00:17:29,753 --> 00:17:34,658
Can't see anything. I see the word array, but I don't actually see an array

301
00:17:34,658 --> 00:17:38,140
And so in order to write code like this, you have to imagine an array in your head

302
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,530
And you essentially have to play computer.

303
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:45,769
You have to simulate in your head what each line of code would do on a computer

304
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:48,772
And people that we consider the skilled software engineers

305
00:17:48,772 --> 00:17:52,805
are just those people that are really good at playing computer

306
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:56,813
But for writing our code on a computer

307
00:17:56,813 --> 00:18:00,750
why are we simulating what a computer would do in our head ?

308
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:05,390
What isn't the computer just do it and show us ?

309
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:08,723
So. Let's write binary search.

310
00:18:08,723 --> 00:18:15,432
function binarySearch, takes a key and an array.

311
00:18:15,432 --> 00:18:18,201
And then over here on this side, it's saying

312
00:18:18,201 --> 00:18:21,404
"Ok, it takes a key and an array, such as what?

313
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:24,074
Give me an example; I need something to work with here."

314
00:18:24,074 --> 00:18:31,114
So, for instance, my array might be 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'.

315
00:18:31,114 --> 00:18:34,723
And let's say for instance we're looking for the 'd'.

316
00:18:34,723 --> 00:18:36,820
So now let's start coding.

317
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:40,358
The lower bound starts out as zero.

318
00:18:40,358 --> 00:18:43,860
Over here it says 'low = 0', nothing amazing there.

319
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:50,639
Upper bound starts out at the end of the array, so 'high = array.length - 1'.

320
00:18:50,639 --> 00:18:53,838
And over here, it says 'high = 5'.

321
00:18:53,838 --> 00:18:57,941
So I have my abstract formula in the code.

322
00:18:57,941 --> 00:19:00,710
Over here, it's giving me the concrete value

323
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,747
corresponding to these example arguments.

324
00:19:03,747 --> 00:19:06,889
So I don't have to maintain this picture in my head;

325
00:19:06,889 --> 00:19:09,729
it's just showing it to me.

326
00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:13,023
So now I need the index in the middle of the array,

327
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,859
so I'm going to take the average of those two.

328
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:22,099
'mid =(low + high)/2', and...well that's obviously not right.

329
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:27,570
2.5 is not a valid array index. So I guess I need to round this off.

330
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:30,806
So I'm going to add the floor function and it rounded it down to 2.

331
00:19:30,806 --> 00:19:38,185
And I caught that bug literally the second I typed it, instead of writing an entire function and twenty unit tests.

332
00:19:38,185 --> 00:19:43,153
So now I get the value out of the array...

333
00:19:43,153 --> 00:19:45,855
and then I need to subdivide my range,

334
00:19:45,855 --> 00:19:51,094
which, so this if statement which I'll just paste in here.

335
00:19:51,094 --> 00:19:53,807
So in this case, the value I found is less than the key,

336
00:19:53,807 --> 00:19:56,198
so it's taking this first branch of the if statement.

337
00:19:56,198 --> 00:20:00,004
This is adjusting the lower bound.

338
00:20:00,004 --> 00:20:02,739
Of course if the key was smaller, then

339
00:20:02,739 --> 00:20:06,075
it would take this branch of the if statement and adjust the upper bound.

340
00:20:06,075 --> 00:20:09,178
Or, if the key was 'c', then

341
00:20:09,178 --> 00:20:13,384
we would've just happened to find it on the first shot,  and we'd return the index.

342
00:20:13,384 --> 00:20:19,422
So this is the first iteration of this algorithm.

343
00:20:19,422 --> 00:20:21,492
And now what we need to do, is loop.

344
00:20:21,492 --> 00:20:23,694
We've subdivided the array, we need to keep subdividing

345
00:20:23,694 --> 00:20:27,306
until we narrow in on what we're looking for.

346
00:20:27,306 --> 00:20:30,306
So, we need to loop; I will just loop.

347
00:20:30,306 --> 00:20:35,472
while 1, do all this.

348
00:20:35,472 --> 00:20:38,241
And now what we have are three columns

349
00:20:38,241 --> 00:20:41,911
corresponding to three iterations of this loop.

350
00:20:41,911 --> 00:20:44,747
So this first column here is exactly what you saw before:

351
00:20:44,747 --> 00:20:49,586
low and high span the entire array, we found a 'c', it was too low,

352
00:20:49,586 --> 00:20:52,757
so we adjusted our lower bound, and loop up to here.

353
00:20:52,757 --> 00:20:56,219
Second iteration, bounds are tighter; we found an 'e'.

354
00:20:56,219 --> 00:20:58,095
We adjust the upper bound.

355
00:20:58,095 --> 00:21:01,397
Third iteration, loop up to here; low and high are the same.

356
00:21:01,397 --> 00:21:03,734
We've narrowed it down to a single candidate -

357
00:21:03,734 --> 00:21:05,718
it's indeed the key we're looking for,

358
00:21:05,718 --> 00:21:08,004
and we returned this index.

359
00:21:08,004 --> 00:21:09,240
So there's nothing hidden here;

360
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,545
you see exactly what the algorithm is doing at every point.

361
00:21:13,545 --> 00:21:15,812
And I can go up to here and try different keys,

362
00:21:15,812 --> 00:21:21,253
so I can see how the algorithm behaves for these different input arguments.

363
00:21:21,253 --> 00:21:22,753
And by looking across this data,

364
00:21:22,753 --> 00:21:27,218
I can develop an intuition for how this algorithm works.

365
00:21:27,218 --> 00:21:33,163
So I'm trying different keys here, and say I try looking for a 'g'.

366
00:21:33,163 --> 00:21:37,533
And this looks a little different. It's not actually returning.

367
00:21:37,533 --> 00:21:43,051
And the reason for this is, I'm looking for a key which is not actually in the array.

368
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:47,410
And the only way of breaking out of this loop, is by finding the key.

369
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:50,847
So it's kinda stuck here looping forever.

370
00:21:50,847 --> 00:21:53,218
So we can take a look at this and see what went wrong,

371
00:21:53,218 --> 00:21:55,184
where's the algorithm going off the rails.

372
00:21:55,184 --> 00:21:58,219
These first few iterations look fine,

373
00:21:58,219 --> 00:22:00,589
but this iteration looks weird,

374
00:22:00,589 --> 00:22:04,468
because low is greater than high.

375
00:22:04,468 --> 00:22:07,386
Our range is completely collapsed.

376
00:22:07,386 --> 00:22:10,900
So if we get to this point, then we know the key can't be found.

377
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:16,005
So I see this faulty condition, and I say, "Oh, that's not right; low has to be less than or equal to high."

378
00:22:16,005 --> 00:22:19,075
Okay, well, I'll just put that over as the condition for my while statement.

379
00:22:19,075 --> 00:22:23,801
'low <= high', and then that would break out of the loop,

380
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:27,550
and I would return some signal to say that it couldn't be found

381
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:30,753
So here we have 3 iterations 'for loop', couldn't be found

382
00:22:30,753 --> 00:22:33,856
We return the 'not valid' value

383
00:22:33,856 --> 00:22:36,759
So that's what it might be like to write an algorithm without a blindfold on.

384
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:46,552
[applause]

385
00:22:46,552 --> 00:22:49,673
So I've got this principle, again,

386
00:22:49,673 --> 00:22:52,385
that creators need to be able to see what they doing.

387
00:22:52,385 --> 00:22:54,478
They need this immediate connection with that they're making.

388
00:22:54,478 --> 00:22:58,315
And I've tried to show this principle through three coding examples,

389
00:22:58,315 --> 00:23:00,816
but that's just because this is a software engineering conference,

390
00:23:00,816 --> 00:23:02,786
I thought I was supposed to talk about programming.

391
00:23:02,786 --> 00:23:07,657
But to me, this principle has nothing to do with programming in particular.

392
00:23:07,657 --> 00:23:11,136
It has to do with any type of creation.

393
00:23:11,136 --> 00:23:12,597
So I'd like to show you a couple more demos,

394
00:23:12,597 --> 00:23:17,168
just to show you the breadth of what I have in mind here.

395
00:23:17,168 --> 00:23:22,219
So, to begin with, let's take a look at a different branch of engineering.

396
00:23:22,219 --> 00:23:25,408
So here I have an electronic circuit that I drew.

397
00:23:25,408 --> 00:23:30,508
I'm not quite done drawing it, so let me finish it up there.

398
00:23:32,016 --> 00:23:36,814
Here we'll put 2. And now we have a working circuit.

399
00:23:37,322 --> 00:23:42,218
I mean I assume it's a working circuit. I don't actually see anything working here.

400
00:23:42,218 --> 00:23:46,396
So this is exactly the same as writing code, that we work in a static representation.

401
00:23:46,396 --> 00:23:49,767
But what we actually care about is the data.

402
00:23:49,767 --> 00:23:52,302
The values of the variables, so we can't see that here.

403
00:23:52,302 --> 00:23:57,006
Now in a circuit, the variables are the voltages on these different wires.

404
00:23:57,006 --> 00:24:00,692
So each of these wires has a voltage that's changing over time,

405
00:24:00,692 --> 00:24:03,112
and we have to be able to see that.

406
00:24:03,112 --> 00:24:06,526
Now, if I was building this circuit on a lab bench, building it physically,

407
00:24:06,526 --> 00:24:09,830
I could at least take an oscilloscope and kinda poke around and see

408
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,693
what's going on in the different wires,

409
00:24:11,693 --> 00:24:12,524
what's going on here, or here.

410
00:24:12,524 --> 00:24:16,559
So at the very least, I should be able to do that.

411
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:21,936
So what I have here, is a plot of the voltage of this wire over time.

412
00:24:21,936 --> 00:24:24,535
You can see it's high, it's low. High.. Low...

413
00:24:24,535 --> 00:24:27,371
So this is clearly oscillating

414
00:24:27,371 --> 00:24:31,307
If I built it physically, also I would be able to see this circuit doing something.

415
00:24:31,307 --> 00:24:34,711
So, in this case I've got these two LEDs up here

416
00:24:34,711 --> 00:24:39,216
These are LEDs, the little lights, presumably there for a reason

417
00:24:39,216 --> 00:24:42,884
I can hit Play and watch it simulate out in real-time

418
00:24:42,884 --> 00:24:51,604
So now you can see what this circuit is doing [applause]

419
00:24:51,604 --> 00:24:53,465
In order to design a circuit like this,

420
00:24:53,465 --> 00:24:56,999
you have to understand the voltage on every wire.

421
00:24:56,999 --> 00:25:00,854
You have to understand how all the voltages are changing throughout the entire circuit.

422
00:25:00,854 --> 00:25:03,037
And just like coding,

423
00:25:03,037 --> 00:25:07,509
either the environment shows that to you, or you simulate it in your head.

424
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:11,114
And I have better things to do with my head, than simulating what electrons are doing.

425
00:25:11,114 --> 00:25:14,936
So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna spread it out a bit.

426
00:25:14,936 --> 00:25:18,103
So same circuit, just spread out a little bit,

427
00:25:18,103 --> 00:25:20,687
and I'm going to add the voltage at every node.

428
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:24,495
So now you can see every voltage throughout the circuit.

429
00:25:24,495 --> 00:25:29,768
And I can even hit Play and watch it all kind of simulate out in real-time.

430
00:25:29,768 --> 00:25:32,902
Although, what I prefer to do is

431
00:25:32,902 --> 00:25:35,071
just move my mouse over it,

432
00:25:35,071 --> 00:25:40,443
and I can kind of look in areas that are interesting to me and see what the values are.

433
00:25:40,443 --> 00:25:42,880
I can compare any two nodes.

434
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,548
So if you look at say the node over here,

435
00:25:44,548 --> 00:25:46,187
while I mouse over this one,

436
00:25:46,187 --> 00:25:49,854
you see the shadow of the one I'm mousing over is overlaid on that.

437
00:25:49,854 --> 00:25:52,989
The shadow of the one I'm mousing over is actually overlaid on all of them.

438
00:25:52,989 --> 00:25:55,291
And so I can compare any two nodes

439
00:25:55,291 --> 00:26:00,029
just by mousing over one of them and looking at the other one.

440
00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:04,103
And again, I can immediately see results of my changes.

441
00:26:04,103 --> 00:26:06,902
So I've got this 70k resistor here.

442
00:26:06,902 --> 00:26:08,770
I want to change its value, I just click and drag it,

443
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:12,575
and now I see the waveforms changing immediately.

444
00:26:12,575 --> 00:26:14,945
And you'll notice that when I click and drag,

445
00:26:14,945 --> 00:26:19,616
it leaves behind the shadow of the waveform before I started dragging,

446
00:26:19,616 --> 00:26:25,687
so I can compare. I can immediately see the results of my changes.

447
00:26:25,687 --> 00:26:30,105
Two golden rules of information design: show the data, show comparisons.

448
00:26:30,105 --> 00:26:32,194
That's all I'm doing here.

449
00:26:32,194 --> 00:26:33,966
But even this isn't quite good enough.

450
00:26:33,966 --> 00:26:35,965
What we're seeing here are the voltages,

451
00:26:35,965 --> 00:26:40,437
but in electronics there are actually two data types. There is voltage and there is current.

452
00:26:40,437 --> 00:26:42,308
And what we're not seeing is the current,

453
00:26:42,308 --> 00:26:44,706
flowing through each of these components.

454
00:26:44,706 --> 00:26:47,853
And in order to design a circuit, you need to understand both the voltage and the current.

455
00:26:47,853 --> 00:26:50,078
You need to understand the interplay between the two.

456
00:26:50,078 --> 00:26:52,215
That's what analog design is.

457
00:26:52,215 --> 00:26:54,769
So what I'm gonna do is spread these out a little bit more.

458
00:26:54,769 --> 00:26:58,154
And now I'm gonna replace each of these components

459
00:26:58,154 --> 00:27:02,124
with a plot of the current going through it over time.

460
00:27:02,124 --> 00:27:05,328
So each of these blue boxes represents a component.

461
00:27:05,328 --> 00:27:07,231
And you can see which component it is,

462
00:27:07,231 --> 00:27:09,967
because it has a little badge in the corner, a little icon,

463
00:27:09,967 --> 00:27:14,270
but now you can see everything that's going on in the circuit.

464
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:18,707
You can see how the current changes, you can see how the current and the voltage changes.

465
00:27:18,707 --> 00:27:23,157
There's nothing hidden, there's nothing to simulate in your head.

466
00:27:23,157 --> 00:27:25,948
So what we have here is

467
00:27:25,948 --> 00:27:28,491
a different way of representing the circuit.

468
00:27:28,491 --> 00:27:32,455
Just in general, you could draw any circuit with these blocks

469
00:27:32,455 --> 00:27:34,657
but instead of being made out of little squiggly symbols,

470
00:27:34,657 --> 00:27:36,826
it's made out of data.

471
00:27:36,826 --> 00:27:38,761
And I think it's important to ask:

472
00:27:38,761 --> 00:27:43,834
Why do we have these squiggly symbols in the first place? Why do they exist?

473
00:27:43,834 --> 00:27:47,901
They exist because they're easy to draw with pencil on paper.

474
00:27:47,901 --> 00:27:49,818
This is not paper.

475
00:27:49,818 --> 00:27:52,175
So when you have a new medium, you have to rethink these things.

476
00:27:52,175 --> 00:27:57,613
You have to think how can this new medium allow us to have a more immediate connection

477
00:27:57,613 --> 00:28:02,418
to what we're making. How can this new medium allow us to work in such a way

478
00:28:02,418 --> 00:28:03,985
that we can see what we're doing.

479
00:28:03,985 --> 00:28:06,755
And it's really the same situation with programming.

480
00:28:06,755 --> 00:28:08,524
Our current conception of what a computer program is 

481
00:28:08,524 --> 00:28:10,234
a list of textual definitions that you hand to a compiler.

482
00:28:10,234 --> 00:28:14,263
That's derived straight from Fortran and ALGOL in the late '50's.

483
00:28:14,263 --> 00:28:17,600
Those languages were designed for punchcards.

484
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,536
See, you'd type your program on a stack of cards,

485
00:28:20,536 --> 00:28:24,106
and hand them to the computer operator, (it's the guy in the bottom picture),

486
00:28:24,106 --> 00:28:26,575
and you would come back later.

487
00:28:26,575 --> 00:28:29,317
So there was no such thing as interactivity back then.

488
00:28:29,317 --> 00:28:35,718
And that assumption is baked into our current notions of what programming is.

489
00:28:35,718 --> 00:28:38,088
C was designed for telepipes.

490
00:28:38,088 --> 00:28:41,157
That's Ken Tompson and Dennis Richie up there.

491
00:28:41,157 --> 00:28:43,151
Richie made C.

492
00:28:43,151 --> 00:28:45,734
And there are no video displays in this picture.

493
00:28:45,734 --> 00:28:50,100
Ritchie is basically typing on a fancy typewriter that types back to him.

494
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:55,972
Any time you use a console or a terminal window, you're emulating a teletype.

495
00:28:55,972 --> 00:28:58,374
And even today, people still think of a REPL

496
00:28:58,374 --> 00:29:02,478
or an interactive top-level as being interactive programming.

497
00:29:02,478 --> 00:29:07,917
Because that's the best thing you could do on a teletype.

498
00:29:07,917 --> 00:29:11,119
So I have one more demo I want to show because I want to emphasize that

499
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:14,957
this principle, immediate connection, is not even about engineering,

500
00:29:14,957 --> 00:29:17,025
it's about any type of creation.

501
00:29:17,025 --> 00:29:20,163
So I want to move to a different field entirely.

502
00:29:20,163 --> 00:29:23,235
So let's think about animation.

503
00:29:23,235 --> 00:29:26,650
So I've got this painting here, of a tree and leaf on it

504
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:33,318
and I want to make a little video with the leaf kinda drifting down the tree.

505
00:29:33,318 --> 00:29:37,650
And the normal way of doing this, in a conventional animation package like Flash,

506
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,150
is through keyframes.

507
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:43,786
So you basically say where you want the leaf to be at different points in time,

508
00:29:43,786 --> 00:29:46,922
and you hit Play and see what it looks like.

509
00:29:46,922 --> 00:29:53,901
So, I'm gonna say: at frame 20, I'm gonna create a keyframe

510
00:29:53,901 --> 00:29:56,567
and the leaf should be there.

511
00:29:56,567 --> 00:30:01,036
At frame 40, create a keyframe and the leaf should be there,

512
00:30:01,036 --> 00:30:04,006
and I'm just totally guessing here. I can not see the motion.

513
00:30:04,006 --> 00:30:05,741
I can not feel the timing,

514
00:30:05,741 --> 00:30:13,568
I'm just throwing things in time and space.

515
00:30:13,568 --> 00:30:15,585
So I've got this leaf at different points in time,

516
00:30:15,585 --> 00:30:20,090
I'm going to add a tween, which tells Flash to connect the dots.

517
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:24,592
And then I'm gonna hit Play and see what it looks like.

518
00:30:24,592 --> 00:30:33,783
And it looks ridiculous, it looks like billiard balls bouncing back and forth.

519
00:30:33,783 --> 00:30:38,607
And the thing is I kind of know what I want, right ? It's a leaf.

520
00:30:38,607 --> 00:30:41,317
I want leaf drifting down from a tree.

521
00:30:41,317 --> 00:30:46,616
And I can even perform that with my hand: leaf drifting down from a tree.

522
00:30:46,616 --> 00:30:49,352
But Flash doesn't know how to listen to my hand.

523
00:30:49,352 --> 00:30:52,988
But maybe there's a new medium

524
00:30:52,988 --> 00:30:56,759
that does know something about listening to my hand.

525
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:59,628
So what I'm gonna show you here is a little app I made

526
00:30:59,628 --> 00:31:02,531
for performing animation.

527
00:31:02,531 --> 00:31:05,167
And we're not really set up for doing a live demo off the iPad

528
00:31:05,167 --> 00:31:11,574
so I'm just gonna show you a video of me making a video.

529
00:31:11,574 --> 00:31:13,319
The way this scene is going to play out is

530
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:15,077
the leaf is gonna kind of drift down from the tree,

531
00:31:15,077 --> 00:31:18,080
and the scene is gonna pan over and the rabbit is gonna do something.

532
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,784
And two things:

533
00:31:21,784 --> 00:31:24,088
one, this is going to move pretty quickly,

534
00:31:24,088 --> 00:31:29,492
and second, I'll be using both hands at almost all times.

535
00:31:29,492 --> 00:31:32,528
So I've got these different layers, the background, the mid-ground and the foreground.

536
00:31:32,528 --> 00:31:35,165
I'm choosing which layer to move using my left thumb.

537
00:31:35,165 --> 00:31:39,202
I'm gonna move my leaf to its position.

538
00:31:39,202 --> 00:31:43,072
I'm gonna move my bunny off stage and start time rolling.

539
00:31:43,072 --> 00:31:49,912
Now I'm gonna perform the leaf drifting down from the tree.

540
00:31:49,912 --> 00:31:52,979
Run it back, check out how that looked.

541
00:31:52,979 --> 00:31:57,419
The motion looks pretty good but the leaf kinda needs to rock back and forth.

542
00:31:57,419 --> 00:31:59,187
So i'm gonna pull out a rotation controller,

543
00:31:59,187 --> 00:32:02,191
run it back, find where the leaf is about to break off,

544
00:32:02,191 --> 00:32:05,426
and record rotation

545
00:32:05,426 --> 00:32:10,100
And I add a little flip there, because it felt right in the moment, wasn't even planned

546
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,235
Stop, because I want to pan over, so I want to drag whole bunch of layers at once

547
00:32:13,235 --> 00:32:16,271
I grab all layers to build a list, i turn down the sensitivity of the background layers

548
00:32:16,271 --> 00:32:18,812
So the leaf would move slower, for a kind of parallax effect

549
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:21,353
I only want to move horizontally, so I pull out a horizontal dragger

550
00:32:21,353 --> 00:32:23,779
And check out how it looks...

551
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:27,583
I don't quite like the parallax, so I adjust a sensitivity a little bit.

552
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:31,686
Try out again. I like that better

553
00:32:31,686 --> 00:32:36,258
So I get ready to go. I run it back to the beginning

554
00:32:36,258 --> 00:32:41,130
so I can kind of get back into the rhythm of the piece.

555
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:45,401
Leaf hits, I wait a bit and I start panning

556
00:32:45,401 --> 00:32:48,269
And I don't know how many frames I waited. I don't know how long it was

557
00:32:48,269 --> 00:32:51,105
I went when it felt right.

558
00:32:51,105 --> 00:32:55,278
So I panned over this winter scene and kind of slowed down to a stop.

559
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:58,145
And then I run it back, because I want to do something with my bunny.

560
00:32:58,145 --> 00:33:01,478
Throw away these tools because I'm done with them.

561
00:33:01,478 --> 00:33:07,155
And wait until I think my bunny should move

562
00:33:07,155 --> 00:33:08,979
and he hops away.

563
00:33:08,979 --> 00:33:12,702
And I have got a few different poses for my bunny. So I pull those out.

564
00:33:12,702 --> 00:33:18,167
And then I find the point when the bunny is about to take off the ground.

565
00:33:18,167 --> 00:33:20,971
Which is right there.

566
00:33:20,971 --> 00:33:25,075
I switch his pose and I kind of toggle between the poses as he hops away.

567
00:33:25,075 --> 00:33:28,411
And then I run it back because I wanna check out how it looked

568
00:33:28,411 --> 00:33:31,015
and I'm just gonna bring that up full screen for you.

569
00:33:31,015 --> 00:33:50,332
This is the piece.

570
00:33:50,332 --> 00:33:54,603
So I made that in 2 minutes, performing with my hands like a musical instrument.

571
00:33:54,603 --> 00:33:58,407
Very immediate connection between me and what I was trying to make.

572
00:33:58,407 --> 00:34:08,252
[applause]

573
00:34:08,252 --> 00:34:10,518
One of the inspirations for this tool

574
00:34:10,518 --> 00:34:14,122
was an animation I tried to make several years ago.

575
00:34:14,122 --> 00:34:18,560
Not that one but it also began with a leaf drifting down from a tree.

576
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,298
And I spent all day in Flash trying to keyframe that leaf.

577
00:34:22,298 --> 00:34:25,812
Couldn't do it.

578
00:34:25,812 --> 00:34:27,727
And so that was the end of that.

579
00:34:27,727 --> 00:34:30,479
I still have my storyboards.

580
00:34:30,479 --> 00:34:32,908
Sometimes I play the music I wrote for the piece.

581
00:34:32,908 --> 00:34:37,477
But the piece itself is locked in my head.

582
00:34:37,477 --> 00:34:40,948
And so I always think about

583
00:34:40,948 --> 00:34:44,729
the millions of pieces that are locked in millions of heads.

584
00:34:44,729 --> 00:34:47,625
And not just animation, and not just art, but

585
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:50,158
all kinds of ideas.

586
00:34:50,158 --> 00:34:53,836
All kinds of ideas, including critically important ideas,

587
00:34:53,836 --> 00:34:56,765
world changing inventions, life saving scientific discoveries.

588
00:34:56,765 --> 00:35:01,671
These are all ideas that must be grown.

589
00:35:01,671 --> 00:35:04,062
And without an environment in which they can grow,

590
00:35:04,062 --> 00:35:06,842
or their creator can nurture them with this immediate connection,

591
00:35:06,842 --> 00:35:11,014
many of these ideas will not emerge.

592
00:35:11,014 --> 00:35:14,018
Or they'll emerge stunted.

593
00:35:14,018 --> 00:35:18,321
So I have this principle that creators need an immediate connection, and

594
00:35:18,321 --> 00:35:23,827
all of these demos that I just showed you simply came from me looking around,

595
00:35:23,827 --> 00:35:27,228
noticing places where this principle was violated,

596
00:35:27,228 --> 00:35:29,229
and then trying to fix that.

597
00:35:29,229 --> 00:35:31,144
It's really all I did.

598
00:35:31,144 --> 00:35:34,069
I just followed this guiding principle

599
00:35:34,069 --> 00:35:41,244
and it guided me to what I had to do.

600
00:35:41,244 --> 00:35:46,348
But I haven't said much about the most important part of the story, which is Why.

601
00:35:46,348 --> 00:35:52,419
Why I have this principle. Why I do this.

602
00:35:52,419 --> 00:35:58,928
When I see a violation of this principle, I don't think of that as an opportunity.

603
00:35:58,928 --> 00:36:03,832
When I see creators constrained by their tools, their ideas compromised,

604
00:36:03,832 --> 00:36:07,070
I don't say: Oh good, an opportunity to make a product.

605
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:10,038
An opportunity to start a business.

606
00:36:10,038 --> 00:36:14,878
Or an opportunity to do research or contribute to a field.

607
00:36:14,878 --> 00:36:17,146
I'm not excited by finding a problem to solve.

608
00:36:17,146 --> 00:36:20,883
I'm not in this for the joy of making things.

609
00:36:20,883 --> 00:36:23,100
Ideas are very precious to me.

610
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,690
And when I see ideas dying, it hurts.

611
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:31,598
I see a tragedy.

612
00:36:31,598 --> 00:36:34,845
To me it feels like a moral wrong, it feels like an injustice.

613
00:36:34,845 --> 00:36:37,166
And if I think there's anything I can do about it,

614
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:40,536
I feel it's my responsibility to do so.

615
00:36:40,536 --> 00:36:44,874
Not opportunity, but responsibility.

616
00:36:44,874 --> 00:36:48,262
Now this is just my thing. I'm not asking you to believe in this the way I believe I do.

617
00:36:48,262 --> 00:36:51,880
My point here is that these words that I'm using:

618
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:57,489
Injustice, Responsibility, Moral wrong,

619
00:36:57,489 --> 00:37:02,124
these aren't the words we normally hear in a technical field.

620
00:37:02,124 --> 00:37:05,430
We do hear these words in association with social causes.

621
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,762
So things like

622
00:37:06,762 --> 00:37:10,632
censorship, gender discrimination, environmental destruction.

623
00:37:10,632 --> 00:37:15,538
We all recognize these things as moral wrongs.

624
00:37:15,538 --> 00:37:19,876
Most of us wouldn't witness a civil rights violation and think "Oh good, an opportunity."

625
00:37:19,876 --> 00:37:21,946
I hope not.

626
00:37:21,946 --> 00:37:25,596
Instead, we've been very fortunate to have people throughout history

627
00:37:25,596 --> 00:37:28,617
who recognized these moral wrongs

628
00:37:28,617 --> 00:37:32,154
and saw it as their responsibility to address them.

629
00:37:32,154 --> 00:37:34,223
And so there's this activist lifestyle where

630
00:37:34,223 --> 00:37:36,763
a person dedicates themselves

631
00:37:36,763 --> 00:37:40,895
to fighting for a cause that they believe in.

632
00:37:40,895 --> 00:37:45,069
And the purpose of this talk is to tell you that

633
00:37:45,069 --> 00:37:48,972
this activist lifestyle is not just for social activism.

634
00:37:48,972 --> 00:37:53,014
As a technologist, you can recognize a wrong in the world.

635
00:37:53,014 --> 00:37:55,878
You can have a vision of what a better world could be.

636
00:37:55,878 --> 00:38:00,181
And you can dedicate yourself to fighting for a principle.

637
00:38:00,181 --> 00:38:02,097
Socially activists typically fight by organizing

638
00:38:02,097 --> 00:38:07,690
but you can fight by inventing.

639
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:12,462
So now I'd like to tell you about a few other people who have lived this way,

640
00:38:12,462 --> 00:38:15,930
starting with Larry Tesler.

641
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:19,013
Larry has done a lot of wonderful things in his life,

642
00:38:19,013 --> 00:38:23,205
but the work I'm gonna tell you about he did in the mid '70s at Xerox PARC.

643
00:38:23,205 --> 00:38:27,513
And at the time, there really wasn't such a thing as personal computers.

644
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,913
The notion of personal computing was very young and

645
00:38:29,913 --> 00:38:33,650
Larry and colleagues at PARC felt that they had transformative potential,

646
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:39,929
that personal computing could change how people thought and lived.

647
00:38:39,929 --> 00:38:43,324
And I think all of us in this room would agree that they turned out to be right about that.

648
00:38:43,324 --> 00:38:45,263
But at the time,

649
00:38:45,263 --> 00:38:49,165
software interfaces were designed around modes.

650
00:38:49,165 --> 00:38:53,870
So, in a text editor for instance, you couldn't just type

651
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:56,429
and have words appear on the screen like on a typewriter.

652
00:38:56,429 --> 00:38:57,873
You would be in command mode.

653
00:38:57,873 --> 00:39:01,189
If you wanted to insert text you'd have to press I to go into insert mode

654
00:39:01,189 --> 00:39:04,279
then Escape back out to command mode or maybe you'd hit A to go into append mode.

655
00:39:04,279 --> 00:39:06,714
Or if you wanted to move text around you'd hit M go to the Move mode

656
00:39:06,714 --> 00:39:09,053
and then you'd have to select and move things around

657
00:39:09,053 --> 00:39:16,157
And Larry would watch people using the computer,

658
00:39:16,157 --> 00:39:20,895
they actually pioneered the concept of software user studies, another thing that he did,

659
00:39:20,895 --> 00:39:24,431
but he would watch people using the software and he found that many people

660
00:39:24,431 --> 00:39:27,535
even after training and weeks of use,

661
00:39:27,535 --> 00:39:31,012
many people would not become comfortable with the computer.

662
00:39:31,012 --> 00:39:35,210
And he believed that it was these modes that were to blame.

663
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:37,509
That the complexity of modes

664
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:41,009
was a kind of barrier that many people couldn't cross.

665
00:39:41,009 --> 00:39:46,105
And so this kind of represented a threat

666
00:39:46,105 --> 00:39:49,590
to this dream of what personal computing could be.

667
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:52,995
So Larry made it his personal mission to eliminate modes from software.

668
00:39:52,995 --> 00:39:54,696
And he formed a principle:

669
00:39:54,696 --> 00:39:58,300
"No person should be trapped in a mode"

670
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,902
His slogan that he would go around saying was

671
00:39:59,902 --> 00:40:04,406
"Don't mode me in" and he had it printed on his t-shirt.

672
00:40:04,406 --> 00:40:07,309
And this principle informed everything that he did.

673
00:40:07,309 --> 00:40:09,478
He thought about it with all the work that he did.

674
00:40:09,478 --> 00:40:13,426
And eventually he came up with a text editor called Gypsy,

675
00:40:13,426 --> 00:40:17,052
which essentially introduced text editing as we know today.

676
00:40:17,052 --> 00:40:19,090
There's an insertion point.

677
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:22,891
And when you typed, words appeared on the screen.

678
00:40:22,891 --> 00:40:26,424
To select text, he invented modeless selection with click and drag.

679
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:30,865
So you just click and drag over the text you want to select like using a highlighter,

680
00:40:30,865 --> 00:40:33,168
one of the first uses of drag.

681
00:40:33,168 --> 00:40:36,138
To move text around, he invented these commands that he called

682
00:40:36,138 --> 00:40:38,238
Cut, Copy, Paste

683
00:40:38,238 --> 00:40:42,045
So you select and Cut, later on you Paste in, whenever you're ready

684
00:40:42,045 --> 00:40:45,112
You're never trapped in a mode, you don't have the switching between modes

685
00:40:45,112 --> 00:40:49,920
When you hit the 'W' key on a keyboard, you get 'W' on the screen, always.

686
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,258
And he would watch people using his software

687
00:40:53,258 --> 00:40:55,691
and he found that someone who had never seen a computer before,

688
00:40:55,691 --> 00:40:57,727
which was most people back then, 

689
00:40:57,727 --> 00:41:00,829
could be up and running in like half an hour.

690
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:02,931
So this was clearly a transformative change

691
00:41:02,931 --> 00:41:05,843
in enabling people to connect with computers.

692
00:41:05,843 --> 00:41:09,303
And his ideas about modelessness

693
00:41:09,303 --> 00:41:11,925
spread to the rest of the desktop interface

694
00:41:11,925 --> 00:41:13,840
which was then being invented at Xeroc PARC at the same time.

695
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:20,816
And today they're so ingrained in the computing experience that today we kind of take them for granted.

696
00:41:20,816 --> 00:41:26,321
Now I said that Larry made the elimination of modes his personal mission.

697
00:41:26,321 --> 00:41:30,126
That's actually his words, and if you think he's exaggerating,

698
00:41:30,126 --> 00:41:37,364
here's Larry's license plate for the last 30 years. [chuckles]

699
00:41:37,364 --> 00:41:41,871
Nowadays of course Larry has a website, at nomodes.com

700
00:41:41,871 --> 00:41:46,408
and he's on twitter: @nomodes

701
00:41:46,408 --> 00:41:49,879
And so like I said, Larry has done a lot of amazing work in his career

702
00:41:49,879 --> 00:41:57,386
but his self identity is clearly associated with this cause.

703
00:41:57,386 --> 00:41:58,591
And so I'd like to ask

704
00:41:58,591 --> 00:42:02,190
What exactly did Larry do?

705
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:06,862
Like how could we best describe what Larry did?

706
00:42:06,862 --> 00:42:09,765
A typical biography might say:

707
00:42:09,765 --> 00:42:13,182
Larry Tesler invented Cut Copy Paste.

708
00:42:13,182 --> 00:42:16,706
Which is true, but I think it's really misleading, because

709
00:42:16,706 --> 00:42:19,840
this invention was very different than

710
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:23,508
say, Thomas Edison inventing the phonograph.

711
00:42:23,508 --> 00:42:26,516
Edison basically just stumbled over the technology for audio recording

712
00:42:26,516 --> 00:42:28,917
and he built it out as a novelly.

713
00:42:28,917 --> 00:42:33,187
And he came up with like a this list of possible applications for his technology, but

714
00:42:33,187 --> 00:42:35,891
he didn't have any cultural intent.

715
00:42:35,891 --> 00:42:38,425
Whereas what Larry did was entirely a reaction

716
00:42:38,425 --> 00:42:41,926
to a particular cultural context.

717
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:44,099
So another thing that you might hear is that

718
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:48,603
Larry Tesler solved the problem of modeless text manipulation.

719
00:42:48,603 --> 00:42:51,541
Solved the problem. And obviously that's true,

720
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:55,310
he worked on the problem for a long time, eventually solved it.

721
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:58,176
But I think that's misleading too,

722
00:42:58,176 --> 00:43:03,617
because this problem that he solved only existed in his own head.

723
00:43:03,617 --> 00:43:07,622
Nobody else saw this as a problem.

724
00:43:07,622 --> 00:43:11,127
For everybody else modes were just how computers worked.

725
00:43:11,127 --> 00:43:13,496
There wasn't anything wrong with them any more than

726
00:43:13,496 --> 00:43:15,399
we think there's something wrong with having two arms.

727
00:43:15,399 --> 00:43:18,340
It just kind of was a fact of life.

728
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,508
So the first thing that Larry did

729
00:43:20,508 --> 00:43:26,925
was that he recognized a wrong that had been unacknowledged in the culture.

730
00:43:26,925 --> 00:43:31,647
And the thing is, that's how many great social changes began as well.

731
00:43:31,647 --> 00:43:35,887
So a 150 years ago, Elizabeth Cady Stanton had to stand up and say:

732
00:43:35,887 --> 00:43:37,887
"Women should vote."

733
00:43:37,887 --> 00:43:40,919
And everybody else said like "That's crazy, what are you talking about ?"

734
00:43:40,919 --> 00:43:44,359
Today, we recognize gender discrimination as a wrong.

735
00:43:44,359 --> 00:43:48,865
Back then, it was part of society, it was invisible.

736
00:43:48,865 --> 00:43:52,198
She had to recognize it, and she had to fight it.

737
00:43:52,198 --> 00:43:56,585
And to me, that's a much closer model to what Larry did

738
00:43:56,585 --> 00:44:01,419
than the Thomas Edison model of inventing a bunch of random technology so he could patent it.

739
00:44:01,419 --> 00:44:03,086
Now to be clear I'm not making any judgement

740
00:44:03,086 --> 00:44:05,513
about the relative importance or the impact of these two people,

741
00:44:05,513 --> 00:44:09,834
I'm just talking about their motivations and their approach.

742
00:44:09,834 --> 00:44:13,023
Both of them recognized a cultural wrong,

743
00:44:13,023 --> 00:44:15,757
they envisioned a world without that wrong

744
00:44:15,757 --> 00:44:19,586
and they dedicated themselves to fighting for a principle.

745
00:44:19,586 --> 00:44:23,668
She fought by organizing, he fought by inventing.

746
00:44:23,668 --> 00:44:28,036
And many other seminal figures in computing had similar motivations.

747
00:44:28,036 --> 00:44:30,374
So certainly Doug Engelbart.

748
00:44:30,374 --> 00:44:34,752
Doug Engelbart basically invented interactive computing.

749
00:44:34,752 --> 00:44:38,545
The concept of putting information on a screen.

750
00:44:38,545 --> 00:44:40,181
Navigating through it.

751
00:44:40,181 --> 00:44:41,920
Looking at information in different ways.

752
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,788
Pointing at things and manipulating them. He came up with all this at a time when

753
00:44:45,788 --> 00:44:49,524
real-time interaction with a computer was just almost unheard of.

754
00:44:49,524 --> 00:44:51,459
Today he is best known as the inventor of the mouse,

755
00:44:51,459 --> 00:44:55,597
but what he really invented with is this entirely new way of working with knowledge.

756
00:44:55,597 --> 00:44:58,599
His explicit goal from the beginning was

757
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:02,772
to enable mankind to solve the world's urgent problems.

758
00:45:02,772 --> 00:45:04,502
And his vision,

759
00:45:04,502 --> 00:45:07,042
he had this this vision of what he called knowledge workers

760
00:45:07,042 --> 00:45:12,347
using complex powerful information tools to harness the collective intelligence.

761
00:45:12,347 --> 00:45:16,117
And he only got into computers because he had a hunch that these new things called computer things

762
00:45:16,117 --> 00:45:18,585
could help him realize that vision.

763
00:45:18,585 --> 00:45:20,419
Everything that he did

764
00:45:20,419 --> 00:45:26,761
was almost single-mindedly driven by pursuing this vision.

765
00:45:26,761 --> 00:45:28,585
Here's Alan Kay.

766
00:45:28,585 --> 00:45:32,085
Alan Kay ran the lab at Xerox PARC where we got the desktop interface,

767
00:45:32,085 --> 00:45:35,637
so things like windows and icons, command menus.

768
00:45:35,637 --> 00:45:40,375
He also invented object-oriented programming and lots of other things.

769
00:45:40,375 --> 00:45:42,308
His goal, and I quote,

770
00:45:42,308 --> 00:45:44,779
was to "amplify human reach,

771
00:45:44,779 --> 00:45:47,549
and bring new ways of thinking to a faltering civilization

772
00:45:47,549 --> 00:45:49,783
that desperately needed it."

773
00:45:49,783 --> 00:45:51,994
Isn't that great?

774
00:45:51,994 --> 00:45:54,751
His approach was through children. He believed that

775
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:58,920
if children became fluent in thinking in the medium of the computer,

776
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:03,835
meaning if programming was a form of basic literacy like reading and writing,

777
00:46:03,835 --> 00:46:06,166
then they'd become adults with new forms of critical thought,

778
00:46:06,166 --> 00:46:07,769
and new ways of understanding the world.

779
00:46:07,769 --> 00:46:10,639
And we'd have this more enlightened society,

780
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:16,836
similar to the difference that literacy brought to society.

781
00:46:16,836 --> 00:46:19,682
And everything that he did, everything he invented,

782
00:46:19,682 --> 00:46:25,006
came out of pursuing this vision, this goal with children.

783
00:46:25,006 --> 00:46:29,918
And following principles that he adopted from Piaget and Montessori,

784
00:46:29,918 --> 00:46:36,836
Jerome Bruner, these people who would study how children think

785
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:40,584
And the figure probably most widely associated with software activism

786
00:46:40,584 --> 00:46:43,204
is Richard Stallman.

787
00:46:43,204 --> 00:46:47,175
Stallman started the GNU project which today makes up a big chunk of any Linux system.

788
00:46:47,175 --> 00:46:49,477
He also started the Free Software Foundation,

789
00:46:49,477 --> 00:46:53,348
wrote GCC, GPL, many, many other things.

790
00:46:53,348 --> 00:46:57,053
His principle is that software must be free, as in freedom,

791
00:46:57,053 --> 00:47:01,390
and he has very precise meaning associated with that statement.

792
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:02,673
He's always been very clear that

793
00:47:02,673 --> 00:47:05,225
software freedom is a matter of moral right and wrong.

794
00:47:05,225 --> 00:47:10,865
And he has taken a particularly uncompromising approach in his own life to that.

795
00:47:10,865 --> 00:47:13,402
All of these tremendously influential people

796
00:47:13,402 --> 00:47:16,205
dedicated their lives

797
00:47:16,205 --> 00:47:20,910
to fighting for a particular ideal with a very clear sense of right and wrong.

798
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:22,758
Often really fighting

799
00:47:22,758 --> 00:47:26,615
against an authority or mainstream that did not recognize their wrong as being wrong.

800
00:47:26,615 --> 00:47:30,335
And today, the world is still very far from any of their ideals

801
00:47:30,335 --> 00:47:32,504
and so they still see a world in crisis

802
00:47:32,504 --> 00:47:41,096
and they keep fighting. They're always fighting.

803
00:47:41,096 --> 00:47:45,135
Now I'm not saying you have to live this way.

804
00:47:45,135 --> 00:47:48,002
I'm not saying that you should live this way.

805
00:47:48,002 --> 00:47:50,506
What I'm saying is that you can.

806
00:47:50,506 --> 00:47:53,174
That this lifestyle is an option that is available to you.

807
00:47:53,174 --> 00:47:55,414
And it's not one you're gonna hear about much.

808
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,248
Your career counselor is not going to come back to you and say:

809
00:47:57,248 --> 00:47:59,681
"You should start a personal crusade."

810
00:47:59,681 --> 00:48:04,186
In a social field, they might, but not in technology.

811
00:48:04,186 --> 00:48:09,757
Instead the world will try to make you define yourself by a skill.

812
00:48:09,757 --> 00:48:12,227
That's why you have a major in college.

813
00:48:12,227 --> 00:48:13,498
That's why you have a job title.

814
00:48:13,498 --> 00:48:16,265
You are a software engineer.

815
00:48:16,265 --> 00:48:18,663
And you'll probably specialize to be a database engineer

816
00:48:18,663 --> 00:48:20,580
or a front-end engineer,

817
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:23,238
and you'll be given front-ends and asked to engineer them.

818
00:48:23,238 --> 00:48:26,175
And that could be worthwhile and valuable,

819
00:48:26,175 --> 00:48:32,347
and if you want to spend your life pursuing excellence and practicing a skill,

820
00:48:32,347 --> 00:48:35,016
you can do that. That is the path of a craftsman.

821
00:48:35,016 --> 00:48:37,299
That is the most common path.

822
00:48:37,299 --> 00:48:40,498
The only other path you really hear about much is the path of the problem solver.

823
00:48:40,498 --> 00:48:45,093
So I see entrepreneurship and academic research as kind of two sides of that coin.

824
00:48:45,093 --> 00:48:46,896
There is the field.

825
00:48:46,896 --> 00:48:50,566
There's the set of problems in that field, or needs in the market.

826
00:48:50,566 --> 00:48:53,936
You go in, you choose one, you work it, you make your contribution there.

827
00:48:53,936 --> 00:48:58,807
Maybe later on, you choose another problem, you work it, you make your contribution there.

828
00:48:58,807 --> 00:49:02,710
Again, that could be worthwhile and valuable and if that's what you want to do,

829
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:04,946
then you can take that path.

830
00:49:04,946 --> 00:49:08,997
But I don't see Larry Tesler on either of those paths.

831
00:49:08,997 --> 00:49:12,620
I wouldn't say he was contributing to the field of user experience design

832
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,888
because there was no such thing.

833
00:49:14,888 --> 00:49:16,891
He didn't choose some open problem to solve,

834
00:49:16,891 --> 00:49:19,664
he came up with some problem that only existed in his own head,

835
00:49:19,664 --> 00:49:21,829
and no one else even recognized.

836
00:49:21,829 --> 00:49:24,766
And certainly he did not define himself by his craft,

837
00:49:24,766 --> 00:49:27,770
he defined himself by his cause.

838
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:31,371
By the principle he fought to uphold.

839
00:49:31,371 --> 00:49:33,508
And I'm sure if you look at Wikipedia it will say that

840
00:49:33,508 --> 00:49:37,812
he's a computer scientist or a user experience something,

841
00:49:37,812 --> 00:49:41,746
but to me that's like saying Elizabeth Cady Stanton was a community organizer.

842
00:49:41,746 --> 00:49:45,454
No, Elizabeth Cady Stanton established the principle

843
00:49:45,454 --> 00:49:48,288
of women's suffrage. That's who she was.

844
00:49:48,288 --> 00:49:50,558
That was the identity she chose

845
00:49:50,558 --> 00:49:54,529
and Larry Tesler established the principle of modelessness.

846
00:49:54,529 --> 00:50:02,470
He had a vision, and he brought the world to that vision.

847
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:05,248
So, you can choose this life.

848
00:50:05,248 --> 00:50:07,374
Or maybe it will end up choosing you.

849
00:50:07,374 --> 00:50:09,477
It might not happen right away.

850
00:50:09,477 --> 00:50:12,247
It can take time to find a principle, because

851
00:50:12,247 --> 00:50:14,783
finding a principle is essentially a form of self-discovery,

852
00:50:14,783 --> 00:50:18,187
that you're trying to figure out what your life is supposed to be about.

853
00:50:18,187 --> 00:50:21,722
What you want to stand for as a person.

854
00:50:21,722 --> 00:50:24,626
Took me like a decade.

855
00:50:24,626 --> 00:50:28,631
Ten years before any real understanding of my principles solidified.

856
00:50:28,631 --> 00:50:30,132
That was my twenties.

857
00:50:30,132 --> 00:50:32,977
When I was young I felt I had to live this way

858
00:50:32,977 --> 00:50:36,271
but I would get little glimmers of what mattered to me

859
00:50:36,271 --> 00:50:38,940
but no big picture. It was really unclear.

860
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:42,043
This was very distressing for me.

861
00:50:42,043 --> 00:50:45,848
What I had to do was just do a lot of things.

862
00:50:45,848 --> 00:50:48,649
Make many things, make many types of things.

863
00:50:48,649 --> 00:50:52,453
Study many things, experience many many things.

864
00:50:52,453 --> 00:50:56,356
And use all these experiences as ways of analyzing myself.

865
00:50:56,356 --> 00:50:58,460
Taking all these experiences and saying:

866
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:00,361
"Does this resonate with me?"

867
00:51:00,361 --> 00:51:02,996
Does this repel me? Do I not care?

868
00:51:02,996 --> 00:51:07,747
Building of this corpus of experiences that I felt very strongly about for some reason

869
00:51:07,747 --> 00:51:10,072
and trying to make sense of it. Trying to figure out Why?

870
00:51:10,072 --> 00:51:15,611
What is this secret ingredient that I'm reacting to so strongly ?

871
00:51:15,611 --> 00:51:17,445
Now I think everyone's different.

872
00:51:17,445 --> 00:51:20,181
And all the guys I talked about they have their own origin stories

873
00:51:20,181 --> 00:51:22,464
which you can read about.

874
00:51:22,464 --> 00:51:24,252
I will just say that

875
00:51:24,252 --> 00:51:26,954
confining yourself to practicing a single skill

876
00:51:26,954 --> 00:51:30,591
can make it difficult to get that broad range of experiences, which

877
00:51:30,591 --> 00:51:36,830
seem to be so valuable for this sort of work.

878
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:39,499
And finally,

879
00:51:39,499 --> 00:51:42,904
if you choose to follow a principle,

880
00:51:42,904 --> 00:51:45,841
a principle can't be just any old thing you believe in.

881
00:51:45,841 --> 00:51:49,143
You'll hear a lot of people say they want to make software easier to use.

882
00:51:49,143 --> 00:51:51,214
Or they want to delight their users.

883
00:51:51,214 --> 00:51:53,081
Or they want to make things simple.

884
00:51:53,081 --> 00:51:55,952
That's a really big one right now. Everyone wants to make things simple.

885
00:51:55,952 --> 00:51:58,452
And those are nice thoughts

886
00:51:58,452 --> 00:52:01,022
and maybe kind of give you a direction to go in

887
00:52:01,022 --> 00:52:05,075
but they're too vague to be directly actionable.

888
00:52:05,075 --> 00:52:06,909
Larry Tesler likes simplicity.

889
00:52:06,909 --> 00:52:09,765
But his principle was this specific nugget of insight:

890
00:52:09,765 --> 00:52:11,767
No person should be trapped in a mode.

891
00:52:11,767 --> 00:52:14,168
And that is a powerful principle

892
00:52:14,168 --> 00:52:17,372
because it gave him a new way of seeing the world.

893
00:52:17,372 --> 00:52:20,541
It divided the world in right and wrong in a fairly objective way.

894
00:52:20,541 --> 00:52:25,246
So, he could look at someone selecting text and ask Is this person in a mode?

895
00:52:25,246 --> 00:52:27,157
Yes or no?

896
00:52:27,157 --> 00:52:30,618
If Yes, he had to do something about that.

897
00:52:30,618 --> 00:52:34,957
And likewise, I believe that creators need powerful tools.

898
00:52:34,957 --> 00:52:38,359
It's a nice thought, but it doesn't really get me anywhere.

899
00:52:38,359 --> 00:52:41,963
My principle is that creators need this immediate connection.

900
00:52:41,963 --> 00:52:45,099
So I can watch you changing a line of code, and I can ask:

901
00:52:45,099 --> 00:52:49,240
"Did you immediately see the effect of that change ?" Yes or no.

902
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:53,207
If No, I got to do something about that.

903
00:52:53,207 --> 00:52:56,242
And again, all those demos that I showed you

904
00:52:56,242 --> 00:52:59,046
came out of me doing that,

905
00:52:59,046 --> 00:53:01,116
of me following this principle

906
00:53:01,116 --> 00:53:04,018
and letting it lead me to exactly what I needed to do.

907
00:53:04,018 --> 00:53:07,158
So if your guiding principle embodies a specific insight,

908
00:53:07,158 --> 00:53:10,491
it will guide you.

909
00:53:10,491 --> 00:53:19,935
And you will always know if what you're doing is right.

910
00:53:19,935 --> 00:53:22,824
There are many ways of living your life.

911
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:24,871
That's maybe the most important thing you can realize in your life,

912
00:53:24,871 --> 00:53:28,777
is that every aspect of your life is a choice.

913
00:53:28,777 --> 00:53:31,646
But there are default choices.

914
00:53:31,646 --> 00:53:33,681
You can choose to sleepwalk through your life

915
00:53:33,681 --> 00:53:36,552
and accept that path that's been laid out for you.

916
00:53:36,552 --> 00:53:40,055
You can choose to accept the world as it is.

917
00:53:40,055 --> 00:53:42,956
But you don't have to.

918
00:53:42,956 --> 00:53:46,127
If there is something in the world you feel is a wrong

919
00:53:46,127 --> 00:53:49,930
and you have a vision for what a better world could be,

920
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:52,834
you can find your guiding principle.

921
00:53:52,834 --> 00:53:56,170
And you can fight for a cause.

922
00:53:56,170 --> 00:53:59,307
So after this talk, I'd like you to take a little time and think about

923
00:53:59,307 --> 00:54:01,574
what matters to you.

924
00:54:01,574 --> 00:54:03,993
What you believe in.

925
00:54:03,993 --> 00:54:06,824
And what you might fight for.

926
00:54:06,824 --> 00:54:10,824
Thank you. [applause]
